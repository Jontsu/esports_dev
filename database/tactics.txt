The game mechanics dictate that champions gain more XP and potentially more gold when they are alone. This is why in early game teams try to divide up the lanes evenly as to maximize XP gain. Additionally, Junglers not only allow the team to tap into an otherwise unused XP/Gold source:the jungle, but also it allows another lane to become solo and thus gain XP at a faster rate. This is not without risk of course, but from a logistics stand point, having a jungler and 2 solo-lanes is extremely efficient and provides a significant bonus against a 2/1/2 lane composition.
Thus when a team fight breaks out and your the most underleveled person on your team, you should go farm and avoid confrontation with the opponent. If you have to oppose the enemy, then do so under your own tower. Most players see the team fight and immediately say "I gotta go help my team!" While not a bad sentiment, discretion is necessary. You must consider what your potential contribution is to the fight vs the risk.
